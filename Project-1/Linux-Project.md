## Linux Practice Projects

This snipe 1 describes how i started by typing ls which means list then i typed mkdir dareyio to create a folder called dareyio then i typed pwd to know the present working directory that am in then i typed cd to take me back home then i typed touch devOps to create a file called devOps. Then i typed ls to see if the newly created file is showing among the list.

In Snipe 2 i continued by typing the command called cp which is for copying then attaching it with the file i wanted to copy and the folder i wanted to copy into so i typed cp devOps /root/dareyio then i typed ls then cd dareyio which means i want to change the directory to dareyio then i typed ls to see the file i copied into dareyio then i saw devOps then i typed cat devOps to see the content of the file but i wasnt able to see any content inside the file because there is no content inside the file.

In Snipe 3 i continued by typing the command mkdir which means to create another directory or folder so i created a directory called Devops_folder then i typed ls to see if its among the list of folders then i used the mv command which means move, so i moved the dareyio folder to the newly created folder called Devops_folder then i typed cd to enter the Devops_folder then i typed ls to see the newly moved folder called dareyio then i typed cd dareyio to enter its directory then i typed ls to see the file inside the dareyio folder.
