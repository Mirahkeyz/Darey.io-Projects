## Linux Practice Projects

This snipe 1 describes how i started by typing ls which means list then i typed mkdir dareyio to create a folder called dareyio then i typed pwd to know the present working directory that am in then i typed cd to take me back home then i typed touch devOps to create a file called devOps. Then i typed ls to see if the newly created file is showing among the list.
