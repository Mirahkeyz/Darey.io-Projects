# AUTOMATING ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION

# Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bation Host)

A Jump Server (sometimes also referred as Bastion Host) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided. The webservers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet. That means, even DevOps engineers cannot SSH into the Web servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server â€“ it provide better security and reduces attack surface.

# TASKS

- Install and configure Ansible client to act as a Jump Server/Bastion Host

- Create a simple Ansible playbook to automate servers configuration

  # STEP 1: LAUNCH AN INSTANCE AND INSTALL ANSIBLE.

  1. Launch an instance and name it Jenkins-Ansible
