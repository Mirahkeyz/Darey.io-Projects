# Ansible Dynamic Assignments And Community Roles

# Step 1: INTRODUCING DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENT INTO OUR STRUCTURE

1. Go to your vscode terminal still on the ansible-config-mgt project start a new branch and call it dynamic-assignments or switch to development branch

2. Create a new folder, name it dynamic-assignments. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it env-vars.yml.

   Note: Depending on what method you used in the previous project you may have or not have roles folder in your GitHub repository – if you used ansible-galaxy, then roles directory was only created on your Jenkins-Ansible server locally. It is recommended to have all the codes managed and tracked in GitHub, so you might want to recreate this structure manually in this case.

3. Your GitHub shall have the following structure by now.

   ├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── inventory
│   └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── roles (optional folder)
    └──...(optional subfolders & files)
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml

Since we will be using the same Ansible to configure multiple environments, and each of these environments will have certain unique attributes, such as servername, ip-address etc., we will need a way to set values to variables per specific environment.

For this reason, we will now create a folder to keep each environment’s variables file. Therefore, create a new folder env-vars, then for each environment, create new YAML files which we will use to set variables.

Your layout should now look like this.

├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── env-vars
    └── dev.yml
    └── stage.yml
    └── uat.yml
    └── prod.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
├── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
    └── webservers.yml

# Step 2: UPDATE SITE.YML WITH DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENTS

Update site.yml with dynamic assignments

Update site.yml file to make use of the dynamic assignment. (At this point, we cannot test it yet. We are just setting the stage for what is yet to come. So hang on to your hats)

site.yml should now look like this.

---
- hosts: all
- name: Include dynamic variables 
  tasks:
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml 
  include: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
  tags:
    - always

-  hosts: webservers
- name: Webserver assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/webservers.yml
