The second Picture shows how i created a new file with the touch command then i wrote a line of code using the echo command which says echo "excited to start my new git project" > index.txt then i added the changes to git staging using the command git add . then i committed the changes to git using the command git commit -m "initial commit".

The third picture shows how i created a new branch called main with the command git checkout -b main then i used the command git branch so that i can see all my branches and the one am currently in. then i switched back to the old branch called master by using the command git checkout master. then i modified my index.txt file by typing echo "adding a new line to my code" > index.txt. then i used the command git status to confirm if it has being modified then i added the changes to git staging by typing the command git add . then i committed the changes with the command git commit -m "adding a new line to my code" then i switched to the main branch by typing git checkout main followed by merging everything done on the master branch to be on the main branch by typing git merge master.
