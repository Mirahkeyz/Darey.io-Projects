# IMPLEMENTING CICD PIPELINE FOR TERRAFORM USING JENKINS

# Prerequisites

- Install "Docker Desktop" and start the engine

- Vscode or any IDE

# Setting Up The Environment

Let's start the project by setting up a jenkins server running in a docker container.

We will create a Dockerfile to define the configuration for our Jenkins server. This Dockerfile will include the necessary dependencies and configurations to run Jenkins seamlessly, and also to run terraform cli.

# Dockerfile for Jenkins

Jenkins comes with a docker image that can be used out of the box to run a container with all the relevant dependencies for jeenkins. But because we have unique requirement to run terraform, we need to find a way to extend the readily available jenkins image

Lets go through that quickly:

1. Create a directory and name it terraform-with-cicd

2. Create a file and name it Dockerfile

3. Add the below content in the Dockerfile

 FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

 USER root

 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
     git \
     unzip \
     wget \
     software-properties-common \
     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common wget \
     && wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
     && gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint \
     && echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list \
     && apt-get update && apt-get install -y terraform \
     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

 WORKDIR /app

 RUN terraform --version

 USER jenkins

# Explaining The Dockerfile

1. # Use the Official Jenkins Base Image

   FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts

This line specifies the base image for your Dockerfile . in this case , it's using the Jenkins official Long Term Support (LTS)

2. # Switch to the root user to add additional packages

     USER root

   Thus command switches to the root user within the docker image. This is done to perform actions that require elevated permissions such as installing packages

3. # Install necessary tools and dependencies (e.g Git, Unzip, Wget)

    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    unzip \
    wget \
    software-properties-common \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

This sections installs various tools and dependencies needed for the image. 

4. # Install Terraform

   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common wget \
    && wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
    && gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint \
    && echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list \
    && apt-get update && apt-get install -y terraform \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

This step installs Terraform. it follows step as before: updating the package list, installing dependencies

5. # Set the working directory

   WORKDIR /app

This line sets the working directory for subsequent commands to /app. This is where you will be when you enter the container

6. # Prints Terraform version to verify installation

   RUN terraform --version

This command prints the version of Terraform to the console, allowing you to verify that the installation is successful

7. # Switch back to the jenkins user

   USER jenkins

Finally, this line switches back to the jenkins user, returning to a lower priviledge level.



# Building and running the docker image

Next is to build the docker image and run it for further configuration

Make sure that you are inside the folder containing the Dockerfile. This is generally referred to as the Docker build context. The build context is the set of files located in the specified directory or path when you build a Docker image using the docker build command . The content of the build context is sent to the Docker daemon during the build process.

1. Build the custom jenkins image

    docker build -t jenkins-server . 

Notice the " . " at the end. That is the docker build context, meaning the current directory where the Dockerfile is.

2. Run the image into a docker container

   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins-server jenkins-server

   This should output a hash data like:

cdbab5b31b8fb59377fa0203826aeb834bc401a01aa24252a3194f4846deb6d9

3. check that the container is running : docker ps

    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                               NAMES
  cdbab5b31b8f jenkins-server   "/usr/bin/tini -- /uâ€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 50000/tcp   jenkins-server

4. Access the Jenkins server from the web browser on localhost:8080

5. Access the Jenkins server directly inside the container

   docker exec -it  cdbab5b31b8f   /bin/bash

6. Retrieve the initial jenkins admin password

   jenkins@cdbab5b31b8f:/app$ cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
a845868b3a404f39b48b1b05137b4888

7. Installing jenkins plugins

   - paste the initial password in the web
   - click "install suggested plugins"
  
8. create admin user and access jenkins

   # Setting up Jenkins for Terraform CI/CD

   1. Fork the directory below into your own github account
  
   https://github.com/darey-devops/terraform-aws-pipeline.git

   2. Do the following to test that the code can create existing resources:
  
      A. The Provider.tf file has an S3 backend configuration. You will need to create your own bucket and update the code
      - Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account
      - update the bucket naame from the backend configuration
      B. Push your latest changes to github

      C. Run Terraform init, plan and apply and confirm everything works fine

          - select username and password. use the Access token generated earlier as your password and specify anything descriptive as your I.D
          - in the credentials section, you will be able to see the created credential
          - Create a second credential for AWS secret and access key. if you have installed the AWS credential plugin you will see the AWS credentials as shown below . simply add the AWS secret and access key generated from AWS console. 
           
          1. Set up a Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline
         
             - From the Jenkins dashboard, click on 'New Item'
             - Give it a name and description and select Multibranch Pipeline
             - select the type of source code and the jenkinsfile
