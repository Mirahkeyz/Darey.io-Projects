WARNING: This infrastructure set up is NOT covered by AWS free tier. Therefore, ensure to DELETE ALL the resources created immediately after finishing the project. Monthly cost may be shockingly high if resources are not deleted. Also, it is strongly recommended to set up a budget and configure notifications when your spendings reach a predefined limit. Watch this video to learn how to configure AWS budget.

In this project, we will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company (Choose an interesting name for it) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website tooling for their DevOps team. As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.
