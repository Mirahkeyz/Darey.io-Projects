# AWS Cloud Solution For 2 Company's Websites Using A Reverse Proxy Technology

WARNING: This infrastructure set up is NOT covered by AWS free tier. Therefore, ensure to DELETE ALL the resources created immediately after finishing the project. Monthly cost may be shockingly high if resources are not deleted. Also, it is strongly recommended to set up a budget and configure notifications when your spendings reach a predefined limit. Watch this video to learn how to configure AWS budget.

In this project, we will build a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network for a fictitious company (Choose an interesting name for it) that uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website tooling for their DevOps team. As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

# Starting Off AWS Project

1. Properly configure your AWS account and Organization Unit Watch How To Do This here
   
- Create an AWS Master account. (Also known as Root Account)

- Within the Root account, create a sub-account and name it DevOps. (You will need another email address to complete this)

- Within the Root account, create an AWS Organization Unit (OU). Name it Dev. (We will launch Dev resources in there) Move the DevOps account into the Dev OU.

- Login to the newly created AWS account using the new email address.

NOTE : As you proceed with configuration, ensure that all resources are appropriately tagged, for example:

- Project:<Give your project a name>

- Environment:<dev>

 3. Create a route table for the public subnets

 4. Create a route table for the private subnets

 5. Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to VPC

 6. Create a Nat Gateway and assign one of the Elastic IPs (*The other 2 will be used by Bastion hosts)

 7. Edit routes of both public and private route-table and add Intenet Gateway and Nat Gateway to them

 8. Edit Subnet Associations of both Public and Private route-table and associate public and private subnets to them
