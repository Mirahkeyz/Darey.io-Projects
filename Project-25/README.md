# ORCHESTRATING CONTAINERS ACROSS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SERVERS WITH KUBERNETES. PART 1

# Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

Container orchestration is a process for automating the deployment, scaling, management, and networking of containers. Here are two key considerations to keep in mind regarding Docker containers:

Ephemeral Nature: Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers are not intended for long-term operation. They are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be easily stopped and destroyed. However, you can recreate a new container from the same Docker image with minimal setup and configuration requirements.

Scalability Across Compute Nodes: To achieve high scalability, Docker containers must be configured to run across multiple compute nodes, which can be either physical servers or virtual machines with the Docker engine installed to manage containers.

Now, let's address a specific scenario based on these considerations:

Consider a situation where you have two compute nodes to run your containers. For instance, Node 1 is hosting a container for a Website, while Node 2 is running a database container. In this setup, two important challenges arise:

Resilience Across Nodes: If a container on Node 1 were to fail or become unavailable, it is essential to ensure that it can be automatically restarted on Node 2. Achieving this kind of resilience typically requires additional orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm or other container orchestration solutions. These tools can monitor the health of containers and automatically redistribute workloads across available nodes to maintain service availability.

Inter-Node Communication: Unlike when containers run on the same host, containers on separate hosts do not have native network communication. To enable communication between the Tooling website container on Node 1 and thedatabase container on Node 2, you need to set up networking solutions specifically designed for cross-node communication. This typically involves creating a custom network overlay that spans both hosts. Orchestration tools mentioned earlier often provide networking features to facilitate this communication.

In summary, while Docker containers offer flexibility and ease of deployment, managing containers across multiple compute nodes introduces challenges related to resilience and inter-node communication. To address these challenges, container orchestration tools and network overlays are commonly employed to ensure the reliable and coordinated operation of containers in distributed environments.

Container orchestration is a concept that allows to address these two scenarios, it provides automation of all the aspects of coordinating and managing containers. Container orchestration is focused on managing life cycle of containers and their dynamic environments.

At its core, container orchestration entails the automation of the complete container lifecycle, orchestrating their deployment across multiple nodes, encompassing tasks such as:

- Configuring and efficiently scheduling containers on nodes.
- Ensuring container availability, even in the face of failures.
- Dynamically scaling containers to evenly distribute application workloads across the infrastructure.
- Resource allocation management among containers.
- Implementing load balancing, traffic routing, and enabling service discovery for containers.
- Continuous health monitoring of containers.
- Ensuring robust security measures for container interactions.
- Kubernetes emerges as a formidable tool designed explicitly for container orchestration, excelling when configured correctly.

# Kubernetes From-Ground-Up

For a better understanding of each aspect of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, I will install each and every component manually from scratch.

To successfully implement "K8s From-Ground-Up", the following and even more will be done as a K8s administrator:

- Install and configure master (also known as control plane) node components and worker nodes.
- Apply security settings across the entire cluster (i.e., encrypting the data in transit, and at rest)
- In transit encryption means encrypting communications over the network using HTTPS
- At rest encryption means encrypting the data stored on a disk
- Plan the capacity for the backend data store etcd
- Configure network plugins for the containers to communicate
- Manage periodical upgrade of the cluster
- Configure observability and auditing

Tools to be used and expected result.

- VM: AWS EC2
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 lts+
- Docker Engine
- kubectl console utility
- cfssl and cfssljson utilities
- Kubernetes cluster

I will create 3 EC2 Instances, and in the end, I will have the following parts of the cluster properly configured:

- One Master node/Control plane.
- Two Worker Nodes
- Configured SSL/TLS certificates for Kubernetes components to communicate securely
- Configured Node Network
- Configured Pod Network

# SETTING UP THE KUBERNETES CLUSTER (MANUALLY)

INSTALL CLIENT TOOLS

Spin up an EC2 Instance and install some tools. This instance will be the client workstation:

awscli – is a unified tool to manage your AWS services.

kubectl – this command line utility will be the main control tool to manage the K8s cluster.

cfssl – an open source toolkit for everything TLS/SSL from Cloudflare

cfssljson – a program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.

# Install and configure AWS CLI

I need to create a user in my AWS console with programmatic access keys configured in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) then Configure AWS CLI to access all AWS services used.

Generate access keys and store them in a safe place.

On my local workstation download and install AWS CLI.

$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install awscli -y

To configure the AWS CLI run:

$ aws configure and follow the prompt.
